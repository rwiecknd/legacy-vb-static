 <title>VectorBase - Low-coverage genome</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/low-coverage-genome</link>
 <description> Refers to the number of overlapping sequences used to build the genomic assembly. High coverage, such as human and mouse genomes, indicates a good amount of sequence information. This is also referred to as deep-coverage. Low coverage, such as the lesser-known mammals, reflects a low amount of sequence information. 2X genomes are low coverage.
