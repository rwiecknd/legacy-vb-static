 <title>VectorBase - YAC (Yeast Artificial Chromosome)</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/yac-yeast-artificial-chromosome</link>
 <description> Originated from a bacterial plasmid, a YAC contains a yeast centromeric region (CEN), a yeast origin of DNA replication, a cluster of unique rectriction sites and a selectable marker and a telomere region at the en of each arm. YACs are capable of cloning extremely large segments of DNA (over 1 megabase long) into a host cell, where the DNA is propagated along with the other chromosomes of the yeast cell.
