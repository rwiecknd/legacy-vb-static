 <title>VectorBase - Start phase</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/start-phase</link>
 <description> In protein-coding exons, the start phase is the place where the intron lands inside the codon : 0 between codons, 1 between the 1st and second base, 2 between the second and 3rd base. Exons therefore have a start phase and an end phase, but introns have just one phase.
