 <title>VectorBase - STS markers</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/sts-markers</link>
 <description> STS markers are short sequences of genomic DNA that can be uniquely amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a pair of primers. Because each is unique, STSs are often used in linkage and radiation hybrid mapping techniques. STSs serve as landmarks on the physical map of the human genome.
