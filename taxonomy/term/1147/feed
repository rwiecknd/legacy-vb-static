 <title>VectorBase - Unigene</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/unigene</link>
 <description> UniGene is an experimental system for automatically partitioning GenBank sequences into a non-redundant set of gene-oriented clusters. Each Unigene cluster contains sequences that represent a unique gene, as well as related information such as the tissue types in which the gene has been expressed and map location.
