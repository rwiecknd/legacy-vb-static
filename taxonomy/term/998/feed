 <title>VectorBase - DWGA (Derived from Whole Genome Alignments)</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/dwga-derived-whole-genome-alignments</link>
 <description> Human versus Chimpanzee exception: The human versus chimpanzee orthologue predictions were obtained in a completely different manner. Since the current chimpanzee genome sequence assembly is the result of low-coverage sequencing, the assembled sequence is of too poor quality to generate a gene set on the classical Ensembl gene build pipeline. The chimpanzee gene set produced by Ensembl has rather been generated by &quot;projecting&quot; human genes to the chimpanzee genome through whole genome BLASTz alignments between both species and filtering for orthologue sequence alignments. The result of this procedure is de facto the human - chimpanzee orthologue set that has been Derived from Whole Genome Alignments (DWGA). See the Prediction Method section on a relevant Ensembl Gene Report page.
