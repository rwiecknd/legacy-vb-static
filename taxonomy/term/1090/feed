 <title>VectorBase - Pseudogene</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/pseudogene</link>
 <description> A noncoding sequence similar to an active protein. A sequence that closely resembles a known functional gene, at another locus within a genome, that is non-functional as a consequence of (usually several) mutations that prevent either its transcription or translation (or both). In general, pseudogenes result from either reverse transcription of a transcript of their &quot;normal&quot; paralog (SO:0000043) (in which case the pseudogene typically lacks introns and includes a poly(A) tail) or from recombination (SO:0000044) (in which case the pseudogene is typically a tandem duplication of its &quot;normal&quot; paralog).
