 <title>VectorBase - QTL (Quantitative Trait Locus)</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/qtl-quantitative-trait-locus</link>
 <description> Genetic loci where allelic variation is associated with variation in a quantitative trait (e.g. blood pressure). The presence of QTL is inferred from genetic mapping. Total variation is partitioned into components linked to a number of discrete, mapped chromosome markers described by statistical association to quantitative variation in a particular phenotypic trait that is thought to be controlled by the cumulative action of alleles at multiple loci.
