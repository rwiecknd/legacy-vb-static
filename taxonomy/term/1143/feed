 <title>VectorBase - tRNA</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/trna</link>
 <description> Transfer RNA. These are identified using tRNAscan. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are approximately 80 nucleotides in length. Their secondary structure includes four short double-helical elements and three loops (D, anti-codon, and T loops). Further hydrogen bonds mediate the characteristic L-shaped molecular structure. Transfer RNAs have two regions of fundamental functional importance: the anti-codon, which is responsible for specific mRNA codon recognition, and the 3&#039; end, to which the tRNA&#039;s corresponding amino acid is attached (by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases). Transfer RNAs cope with the degeneracy of the genetic code in two manners: having more than one tRNA (with a specific anti-codon) for a particular amino acid; and &#039;wobble&#039; base-pairing, i.e. permitting non-standard base-pairing at the 3rd anti-codon position.
