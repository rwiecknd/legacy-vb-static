        The RNA component of Ribonuclease P (RNase P), a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Its best characterized activity is the generation of mature 5 prime ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5 prime leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzymes have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous. Helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs. <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000386">Source: http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000386</a>        </dd>

         <p>(also whole genome shotgun) Semi-automated sequencing method that involves randomly sequenced cloned pieces of the genome (size selected, sually 2, 10, 50 and 150 kb), with no prior knowledge their location. The clones are then sequenced from both ends. The two ends of the same <a href="https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary#Clone" title="A segment of DNA that has been inserted into a vector molecule, such as a plasmid, and then replicated to form many identical copies." class="lexicon-term active">clone</a> are referred to as mate pairs. The distance between two "mate pairs" can be inferred if the library size is known and has a narrow window of deviation. This approach can be contrasted with "directed" strategies, in which pieces of DNA from known chromosomal locations are sequenced.</p>

        The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein. It is involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most eubacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, with eight helical elements. These fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region. Eubacterial SRP is generally a simpler structure, with the M domain of Ffh bound to a region of the 4.5S RNA that corresponds to helix 8 of the eukaryotic and archaeal SRP S domain. Some Gram-positive bacteria (<em>e.g. Bacillus subtilis</em>), however, have a larger SRP RNA that also has an Alu domain. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54/Ffh M domain mediates signal sequence recognition. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilizes helix 8 for SRP54 binding. <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000590">Source: http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000590</a>        </dd>
