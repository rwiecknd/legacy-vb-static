 <title>VectorBase - SEG</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/seg</link>
 <description> Seg divides sequences into contrasting segments of low-complexity and high-complexity. Low-complexity segments defined by the algorithm represent &quot;simple sequences&quot; or &quot;compositionally-biased regions&quot;. Segment lengths and the number of segments per sequence are determined automatically by the algorithm.
