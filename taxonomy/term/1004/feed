 <title>VectorBase - Eponine</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/eponine</link>
 <description> Eponine is a probabilistic method for detecting transcription start sites (TSS) in mammalian genomic sequence, with good specificity and excellent positional accuracy. Eponine models consist of a set of DNA weight matrices recognizing specific sequence motifs. Each of these is associated with a position distribution relative to the TSS.
