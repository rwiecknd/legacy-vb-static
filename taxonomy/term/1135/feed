 <title>VectorBase - Toplevel</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/toplevel</link>
 <description> The largest continuous sequence for an organism. The official technical definition for toplevel sequences are &#039;sequence regions in the genome assembly that are not a component of another sequence region&#039;. For example, when a genome is assembled into chromosomes, toplevel sequences will be chromosomes and unplaced scaffolds. If a genome has only been assembled into scaffolds, then toplevel sequences are scaffolds and unplaced contigs.
