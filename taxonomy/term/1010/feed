 <title>VectorBase - Fgenes</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/fgenes</link>
 <description> FGENES, also known as Find Genes, is a Human gene predictor that is based on pattern recognition of different types of exons, promoters and poly A signals. It is built based on linear discriminant functions of internal, 5&#039;-coding, and 3&#039;-coding exon recognition. It is designed to find the optimal combination of these components and to construct a set of gene models along a given sequence.
