 <title>VectorBase - SignalP</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/signalp</link>
 <description> The SignalP application predicts the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in amino acid sequences from different organisms: Gram-positive prokaryotes, Gram-negative prokaryotes, and eukaryotes. The method incorporates a prediction of cleavage sites and a signal peptide/non-signal peptide prediction based on a combination of several artificial neural networks. Signal peptides indicate a protein that will be secreted. Prediction of signal peptides is quite accurate however care must be exercised and these regions should be verified by other means.
