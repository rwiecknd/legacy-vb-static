 <title>VectorBase - GenBank WGS</title>
 <link>https://legacy.vectorbase.org/glossary/genbank-wgs</link>
 <description> GenBank accession for a Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) project. This is the master accession which should link to both contigs and scaffold data for the species. If an assembly is changed the WGS accession will be modified. It is possible that the assembly improvement involves re-scaffolding and the underlying contig sequences can be unchanged.
